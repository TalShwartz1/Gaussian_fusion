# Latent Gaussian Splatting 

> A novel approach for text-guided 3D shape generation that enhances the Latent-NeRF framework by replacing the NeRF architecture with Gaussian Splatting.

## Overview
> This project improves text-to-3D generation by introducing two key modifications to the Latent-NeRF framework by replacing the NeRF architecture with Gaussian Splatting, which has shown promise in novel view synthesis
> Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements across multiple metrics:

-More detailed object generation
-Higher PSNR and SSIM scores
-Clearer and sharper scenes with better multi-view consistency
-Reduced visual artifacts
-More comprehensive viewing angles

## Acknowledgments
The `Latent-NeRF` code is heavily based on the [stable-dreamfusion](https://github.com/ashawkey/stable-dreamfusion) project, and the `Latent-Paint` code borrows from [text2mesh](https://github.com/threedle/text2mesh).
